# SurakshaVerse

SurakshaVerse is a web-based cyber security awareness and training platform that combines gamified learning with simulated AI-based cyber threat analysis. The project focuses on improving cyber awareness, response skills, and digital safety among students, citizens, and institutions.

## Problem Statement

Cybercrime incidents such as phishing, UPI fraud, ransomware, identity theft, and emerging zero-day attacks are increasing rapidly. Most existing cyber security tools are complex, expensive, and designed only for technical experts. There is a lack of simple, interactive platforms that both demonstrate cyber threats and train users in a realistic and engaging way.

---

## Proposed Solution

SurakshaVerse provides a unified platform that allows users to experience cybercrime scenarios through interactive simulations. Users make decisions during simulated cyber attacks, receive scores and feedback, and learn correct response actions. The platform demonstrates early threat indicators and promotes proactive cyber safety behavior.
